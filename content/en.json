    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "As you may have noticed, my name is Lucas Alvarenga, or also known as Alvarenga! I'm a highly motivated and experienced self-taught Android Developer with nearly 4 years of experience developing high-quality mobile apps. Strong ability to design, develop and test Android applications, with in-depth knowledge of relevant programming languages, libraries and frameworks. Excellent problem-solving skills, team collaboration and self-management. I seek to contribute to the success of the company by providing efficient solutions in Android development. <br /><br /> I started programming when I was 13 years old precisely with Android, but using Java in 2017. As I was close to entering high school, I wanted to attend a technical school. So, the following year, I enrolled at the Rezende Rammel technical school to take a computer course. It was an incredible 3 years, as I increased my knowledge in the area. Even focusing heavily on Java and, later, on Kotlin, I was able to have contact with other languages such as JavaScript, Php, C, Pascal and Frameworks such as React.Js and Flutter. <br /><br /> When the year 2020 came, I was determined to start my career as an Android Developer once and for all, so I went through many selection processes and interviews until I got an internship and was hired in only 3 months. In the meantime, I've been a technology content creator since August 2019, where I 'documented' my journey from student to software developer. <br /><br />"
